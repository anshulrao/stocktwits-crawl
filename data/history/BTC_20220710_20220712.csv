Signs of a slowing economy are now emerging. However, this week&#39;s PPI, CPI, and Retail reports will reflect a backward looking data set. Last month&#39;s data is likely to still be hot, while current and forward-looking data may show a cooling economy. 
 
Take aways: An economic recession, and a profits recession are two different events. The market is still trying to determine what type of a recession is coming, although we certainly could see both types of recession in the economy and corporate profits. 
 
The market has likely priced in a shallow recession of short duration already. If we are able to avoid a deeper recession of longer duration, then it is possible that the bear market bottom may already be in. The next bull market starts at the bottom of the current bear market."

As a citizen, you can protect yourself from excessive currency printing by investing in bitcoin $BTC.X or other hard assets that cannot be printed for free. When held in self-custody, bitcoin has a hard cap and cannot be inflated. People who live in high-inflation areas could use bitcoin as a technology to store value and protect themselves from inflation. Furthermore, individuals who were unable to access their funds at Chinese commercial banks may benefit from a solid umbrella under bitcoin.

So Tuesday, ‚Äústocks might be struggling for direction ahead of a pivotal inflation report,‚Äù wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.  
 
But the real market movements will likely happen Wednesday, when the consumer price index is released. Economists expect the second consecutive reading of more than 8% annualized growth in prices‚Äîand if markets see the result as too high, it will spur bets that the Federal Reserve isn‚Äôt yet close to slowing down the pace of interest rate hikes. That could stoke a stock market selloff. If inflation comes in lighter than expected, especially with oil prices down, stocks could rally."

The U.S. Dollar Index dipped slightly into the red Tuesday to just over 108. That‚Äôs still close to a new multi-decade high. The greenback is now up about 17% in the past year and it‚Äôs up double digits in percentage terms for 2022.  
 
That‚Äôs not only a sign that investors are seeking the safety of the dollar, but it also threatens to dent U.S. companies‚Äô earnings. That‚Äôs because sales made overseas translate into fewer dollars when the dollar strengthens. Historically, every percentage point gain in the dollar year-over-year translates into a half percentage point drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share growth, according to Morgan Stanley ."

The attempt took place ‚Äúrecently,‚Äù the Frankfurt-based central bank for the 19 countries that use the euro said in an emailed response to a query about a report by Business Insider. The bank added that ‚Äúit was identified and halted quickly‚Äù but that it had nothing more to say amid an investigation. 
 
Business Insider reported, that Lagarde was contacted by text message from what appeared to be former German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s cellphone number by someone claiming that Merkel wanted to communicate with her by WhatsApp because that would be more secure. 
 
It said that Lagarde then contacted Merkel by phone to ask whether she really wanted to communicate by WhatsApp; the attempt apparently aimed to gain control of the accounts of prominent figures."

This cross so far in the past has marked the bottom of the bear market. Boys and girls, I think we are either AT bottom or about to capitulate in the next 24 to 48 hrs. Bottom may just mean we are going to revisit the prior lows from June 18 or could be lower. I am not trying to time the exact bottom so I am already averaging in myself. Not telling anyone else what to do. This is just my plan. I am backing up the truck and opening the rear gate and gonna sleep in the truck.

 con&#39;d the naive crypto crowd.

Gullible crowd.

In its previous advertising, Voyager appeared to be saying that its own customers would be protected by the FDIC, pointing to its accounts at New York-based Metropolitan Commercial Bank. For its part, this week Metropolitan put up a statement on its website refuting the Voyager claim.

&quot;FDIC insurance coverage is available only to protect against the failure of Metropolitan Commercial Bank,&quot; the statement said. &quot;FDIC insurance does not protect against the failure of Voyager, any act or omission of Voyager or its employees, or the loss in value of cryptocurrency or other assets.&quot;

Voyager held an omnibus account at the bank for U.S. dollars, the statement added.

An FDIC spokesperson told CoinDesk Voyager is not a bank or savings association, and therefore not qualified for FDIC insurance."

The artificial gravity used for propulsion attracts surrounding air molecules.  Why?  Because gravity attracts mass, aka atoms/molecules.  That&#39;s what gravity does. 
 
Recall that sound waves need air to propagate from the source (say, a drum you&#39;re playing) to the destination (the jerks in the upstairs apartment - they hate that drumming). 
 
You switch on your artificial gravity system, the surrounding air gets attracted to your system.  The drum&#39;s sound waves no longer propagate because the surrounding air molecules are sucked in around the gravity system. 
 
The &#39;humming&#39; sound of UFOs reported by witnesses only occurs when the witness is *right under* or next to the UFO.  Otherwise all the air around the UFO is trapped and will not allow sound from the vehicle to propagate outward a normal distance. 
 
By the way these vehicles (most of them anyway) are made on earth by us."

2022-07-11T22:50:02Z,grgfchs,465132,NIL,"$BTC.X If you took a ride in an artificial gravity vehicle, the novelty would be (initially) impressive to you because of the immense distance you could travel in a few minutes (coast to coast).    
 
But you&#39;d lose the sense of novelty FAST because gravity vehicles - when they accelerate - do not &#39;push you back deep into the seat&#39; like in a car or during takeoff in a jet.   
 
Gravity vehicles accelerate without inertial drag.  &#39;Inertial drag&#39; is the physical effect of all the charged particles of your body (and the sports car for that matter) feeling &#39;resistance&#39; to the acceleration. 
 
Gravity is, in fact, an acceleration without inertial drag. 
 
You would get in the vehicle, fly to a different coast (thousands of miles) in a few brief minutes, and not feel any acceleration.  No &#39;pushed back deep into the seat.&#39; 
 
So the novelty of high acceleration that you cannot feel (because there&#39;s no inertial drag) would wear off.  Fast."

Looking ahead this week, 3 key economic data points that are relevant for the market&#39;s assessment of inflationary pressures: Wednesday is Consumer Price Index (CPI), Thursday is Producer Price Index (PPI), Friday is Retail Sales. All 3 reports are likely to come in too high. Although the Retail Sales report has the potential to begin to show early signs of consumer weakness.  
 
Keep in mind, these are rearview mirror data points. The market is already heavily sold, with a great deal of bad news already factored in. This gives us room for an upside surprise in future economic data reports that indicate inflation is retreating.  
 
I do not expect this week to provide those upside surprises in economic data that could launch a 5% rally higher in the market. However, the definition of a surprise is that we don&#39;t expect it. Still, I believe our upside surprises for softer economic data pointing to slowing inflation are forward looking, not backward.

Watch BTC to see what bigger players are doing with their money. Looks like they are pulling out of the market right now. Becareful bulls. Nothing wrong with staying cash, shorting, or playing inverses until the dust settles.

I wouldn&#39;t expect reversals until these numbers come in and are absorbed (usually day after). Any potential reversal is just a pullback waiting to get sold into until then. FYI, bears are waiting patiently to retest and take out today&#39;s lows on momentum.

The Gray Glacier update, released by Ethereum developers on June 30, postponed the network&#39;s impending difficulty bomb, delaying The Merge at least until September 2022. In the meantime, there are currently over 13 million Ethereum locked onto the Beacon Chain, valued at $15.8 billion at the current pricing.  
More than 13 million ETH have been deposited into the ETH 2.0 contract this week, and there are currently 406,640 validators. The Ethereum (ETH) blockchain is anticipated to switch over to a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain in the future. The network currently uses a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) architecture for the main chain and beacon chain, respectively. The 13,012,469 ether locked inside the ETH 2.0 at the time of writing the .contract is worth more than $15.8 billion using current ETH exchange rates

That 5 years in jail for having possession of crack video by joe Biden is clear evidence that they disproportionately wanted to attack black communities and steal their properties they owned, just for possession of crack. Which was obviously an attack on one demographic of people, while rich white people had cocaine. 

They come off to sound like they‚Äôre doing everyone a favor, when in reality, they just want to steal your stuff and kick you when you‚Äôre down. 

They‚Äôll do the same with bitcoin. Drive prices up high enough for retail to FOMO, and then attack it to force retail to sell at high liquidity ranges. Then they slowly buy it back at cheaper prices.

Those who follow know I was posting about Sri Lanka months ago because it&#39;s the canary in the coal mine for what is likely to be an emerging market debt/financial crisis as the dollar soars and foreign reserves fall. 
 
Sri Lanka has utterly collapsed after running out of FX. India (who is pledging to help) has 10 months of reserves left to fund its own imports. 
 
Myannmar, Pakistan and Argentina for example have all put in place import bans to keep FX from leaving the country. The WSJ finally put out a piece covering this: 
 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/sri-lanka-crisis-flashes-warning-for-other-indebted-economies-11657473277 
 
To put this problem another way, imagine you borrowed 100 $BTC.X when it was only worth $100/coin. You had a $10k debt. No problem. Then imagine repaying that debt as $BTC.X soared to $10k, now your debt is $1 million. Big problem.

3) Same for conventional brokerage... broker failure is insured up to 250k cash and 500k in securities. 
 
Crypto? It&#39;s a fucking anarchy with none of that. Just a lot of GREED and gullibility.

Making 550% - 6.5x profit is important! 
Protecting your profit from 77% drop is more important! 
 
 Did you scare to buy cryptocurrencies after EngineeringRobo gave buy signals at the beginning of Feb 2022? 
 
 How many times did you panic sell because of the red candles since then? 
 How many times did you hesitate to buy during the red candles? 
 Do you think the color of a candle or bar affects certain people when trading?  
 
Imagine that you had placed a buy order at your support level and that you were looking to buy at or near the line. Would you have found it more difficult to buy if you saw the big red down candles?  
 
Is it easier to sell after EngineeringRobo&#39;s sell #signals (often the best time to sell) if you don&#39;t see a lot of green?"

The break below a falling wedge is bearish and a bear üêª flag üö©could be forming at the current level if the 200 week moving average resistance level fails to break and turn into support &gt;&gt;

Bulls ü¶¨ need a break above descending resistance to signal breakout higher &gt;&gt;

FOLLOW THE CHARTS &amp; NOT THE CHATTER! 

https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/learn-to-trade/indicators-and-patterns/bullish-patterns/falling-wedge-pattern/

What is the Falling Wedge?

The falling wedge is a bullish pattern. Together with the rising wedge formation, these two create a powerful pattern that signals a change in the trend direction. In general, a falling wedge pattern is considered to be a reversal pattern, although there are examples when it facilitates a continuation of the same trend. 

What the Falling Wedge Tells Us

The falling wedge pattern is a technical formation that signals the end of the consolidation phase that facilitated a pull back lower. As outlined earlier, falling wedges can be both a reversal and continuation pattern.

Now if this is the case then the reason for these rallys is to send coins that have officially bottomed up so when btc drops from 25k those coins will have enough power to hold above their bottom.

This morning I spoke to one of my closest girlfriends who also lives in Bermuda 

‚Ä¶we briefly chatted about bitcoin (it‚Äôs been popular here for longer even before it was ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù)

She bought bitcoin roughly 10 years ago when she was in her 20s at 13 to 15 dollars per btc

She bought 200 bitcoins and it cost her 3K

She bought btc because one of our other close friends a physicist explained it to her and took the time to get her into it help her set it up etc

1/ Has she taken profits along the way ?

The answer is no 

2/ Did she try to time the top or bottom ?

The answer is no 

She told me today she is selling her btc when it hits 300K per and not before this is her exit strategy she has never deviated from this strategy  

She said she thinks it will happen by the year 2030 while she is still young enough to enjoy her life and at which time she will cash out

200 btc sold at 300K per is 60 million
She put in 3K has never touched

Just one way to win and execute"

Happy Sunday

So let‚Äôs review

We had two cycle tops in 2021 

April 64K

And 

Nov 68K

Usually the bottom is one year after the cycle top and it can drop about 80 percent plus

So the recent drop of 74 percent was 
17 600 which could be the cycle bottom

Do you think it was? 

However many also think that the bottom will be in November this year ‚Ä¶one year after the second cycle top that we reached (68K) and around 15K

My thoughts on where the mkt heads this week ... 

We have had quite a few important weeks this year already, but as I write in my Game Plan going out to members in a few hours (email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com to join), this week is pivotal. We not only have the start of the most important earnings season in recent history and an extremely important readout of inflation data, we have technical setups of key stocks that are on the verge of a breakout. Ones that can move our indexes. Can the bulls give mkts one more nudge? 

In my Game Plan this week, I lay out where we are headed technically, what I think of this weeks most important  earnings reports,  six bullish setups, four bearish setups, and a few other nuggets. 

Get ready for some big swings this week with plenty of traps for both bulls and bears. Remember .... have patience and be nimble. That is the recipe in bear mkts. ‚úåÔ∏è"

Wait until btc breaks out in at least the 3 month chart in my opinion combined with big volume. Consistent big volume. It&#39;s better to buy once bull run confirmed if you are going long. Would you rather buy 10% too late or 33% 40% too early?. That&#39;s fior everybody to decide for themselves. Fuck FOMO. This isn&#39;t going from x to 5x or 6x in 3 minute time span. You have time.  Deep breath. Watch the charts. Watch the volume. Swing trades for now if you can halfass read a chart.  Going long before reversal is actually confirmed is giving money away. It&#39;s gotta break out and hold this with big volume along with it. Gl

My faith in you was strong and sure;
We had such trust as should endure,
No spats between us ever rose;
Our friends were like - and so, our foes.

What sadness, then my friend, to find,
That after all, you weren&#39;t so kind,
The day my life on earth did end,
I found you weren&#39;t a faithful friend.

For all those years we spent on earth,
You never talked of second birth.
You never spoke of my lost soul,
And of the Christ who&#39;d make me whole!

I plead today from hell&#39;s cruel fire,
And tell you now my least desire -
You cannot do a thing for me;
No words today my bonds will free.

But do not err, my friend, again -
Do all you can for souls of men.
Plead with them now quite earnestly,
Lest they be cast in hell with me.&quot;

-- Author Unknown

I implore you to seek Jesus while He can be found.

Equities also do same basically its all investors money, but difference with equities

VC and Institutes fund the company during private and as startup and dump on retail and small tutes taking it to public after completing locking period and rinse and repeat, while retail investors and small tutes will be baghold or start shorting with cutting the PT

But here in crypto no company behind to blame

- what the fuck these greedy delusional bull pigs done when Voyagure filed bankrupt and suspended trade, withdrawal many hard earned workers money locked in voyageurs wallets

- where these pigs gone when squid token, safemoon, luna they all scammed?

- where they watching when solana is being accused by fear from investors
