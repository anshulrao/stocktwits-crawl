Obviously no one in crypto land read this in 2021 as 3 of the biggest crypto exchanges are now in bankruptcy court.

Dr Michael Burry warned crypto land in the summer of 2021 that if you don‚Äôt know the leverage problem in the crypto space then you don‚Äôt know crypto.

Those people are now either broke or in bankruptcy court. 2022 is the worst year for the stock market since 1970 and its been the worst year for the bond market since 1788 and bitcoin had its worst month in June 2022 since 2008 down -70% from the sweet and delicious 69k highs from Nov 2021. $BTC.X $MSTR $SPY $DIA $QQQ

Its been 4 weeks since the low and there was a good amount of acceleration on the last leg down. By no means is the price action showing a decisive bottoming formation. Think the right move is to stay away for the time being.

Crypto connect, progress in the Gig Economy, a new partner in the Creator Economy, and the inclusion of several new crypto coins coming to the Bakkt platform. These are all revenue generating advancements. 
 
Possibly, the long-awaited launch of the crypto connect platform has finally taken place, or it will launch soon. This could be very significant for increasing revenues as existing and new bank partners ramp up their rollout of crypto connect to their customer bases."

At about the 52:27 mark Gavin gives the name of the company in this new partnership. I am unable to identify the name of this new partner, so I am reaching out to the company to try to learn more. If anyone has any due diligence on this new partner, then please share. Thanks!

Small account problems?  PDT in your way?

- trade offshore.  PDT doesn&#39;t affect offshore accts.  CMEG may be a good start.

- trade futures.  PDT doesn&#39;t exist in futures markets.  Look into Tradeovate.  You can trade mes contracts for as low as $55 per contract ($550 for /ES, /NQ, /YM). 

- use a prop firm.  APEX may be worth looking into (see my most recent YouTube videos).  Other firms, such as Frontier, are available for equities.

- trade options in a CASH account. PDT doesn&#39;t apply to CASH accts. Options settle NEXT day.  So you can take as many trades per day as you can afford, then recycle your capital for trading the next day (I have a fee videos talking about this).

- trade in more than one acct.  Buy/short what you want to trade, then do the opposite in the other acct when you want out of the trade (most brokers require $2k to short, so keep this in mind). 

There are other venues as well...

Altcoins may dump much larger, since $eth.x seems to have become more of a sentiment for altcoin price indication than bitcoin now. And since ETH is moving over to POS, ASIC miners have more incentives to dump at higher liquidity.

However, ASICs are like only 40% of the miners. GPU miners making up for the 60%. ASIC miners most likely dumped what they wanted by now anyway. And since ETH was mined first n now moving to PoS, that gives it the commodity + security debate. Kinda bullish. Except that there‚Äôs no hard cap. Lol. Dilemmas. Tuff."

Where did they go?  THE PRIVATE MARKETS.   Because a private investment CANNOT be at $100/share on Monday, then $2/share on Tuesday due to public panic.  Private assets don&#39;t trade publicly and are not subjected to the public&#39;s whims.

In the long term the viability of gold as a store of value will be utterly destroyed, and almost all of the money that was formerly in gold should rationally transfer to bitcoin.

So it&#39;s almost impossible for a swing trader to lose more than 3% in a trading session.  Usually it&#39;s a slight gain.  Usually we sit on the sidelines and look for a good set up. Then we plan for a few hours to exit.  So the risk of catastrophic loss is 0 unless you go to sleep.

 I&#39;m not bragging what I am saying is I don&#39;t understand longs who will put their entire money in and risk 50% loss or more for hopes and dreams. And I know for a fact once you&#39;re down 25% you can&#39;t sell your trap.  Then the only thing you can do is hope more."

WASHINGTON, D.C. ‚Äî Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh spoke with reporters Friday to clarify previous remarks that the rate of inflation had hit 9.1% in June. He explained that his office had accidentally placed the decimal in the wrong place and inflation is actually 91%, the highest it has ever been. He apologized for the error.

&quot;Oops, sorry about that folks. Apologies all around,&quot; said Sec Walsh. &quot;My notes had a pretty glaring typo. Inflation is actually 91%. Wow, yeah ‚Äî that&#39;s pretty high. That&#39;s, like, the highest it&#39;s ever been in recorded history, I think. I will not be taking any questions.‚Äù

The announcement was met with sighs of relief from the upper class of society who will not be affected by this news in any meaningful way.

At publishing time, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen argued that the sales tax rate should be increased to 91% to compete with inflation.

(Post 1 of 3) 
It has been one of the most brutal bears in market history for the last 7 months, combined with crypto winter at the same time for the crypto-adjacent stocks. However, all market cycles eventually run their courses, and then transition to the next phase of the eternal battle between bulls and bears in markets.  
 
The bear market and crypto winter may be at, or near, a bottom. In this scenario, we want to consider favorite ideas in the space that may be oversold now, and also be on the leading edge of numerous bullish catalysts ahead: 
 
A few thoughts on the Bakkt (BKKT) trade:  
* Bakkt is 66% owned by ICE, another 12% owned by SBUX and MSFT, and is launching partnerships with Wyndham, Mastercard, SBUX, BringMeThat, a growing list of banks on Bakkt&#39;s crypto connect platform, etc."
2022-07-15T23:00:40Z,BullnBearTrading,1578839,Bullish,"$BKKT $BTC.X  
(Post 2 of 3) 
 
* The current bottoming pattern on Bakkt&#39;s daily chart may be an inflection point. The bear market in stocks may be close to ending, and traders know this. The bear market will end at least 6 months ahead of the bottom in the economy, so oversold issues like Bakkt may have already bottomed. 
 
* Crypto winter is running its course as excess speculation is being flushed out in a healthy purge of flawed business models. Happens in every technology revolution wave, crypto is no exception. Solid, new infrastructure continues to be built globally. The crypto economy is about to explode higher on the next leg of the new bull market. 
 
* Bakkt will continue to ramp up revenues from partnerships already launched, and will launch a succession of new partnerships, including Mastercard. Revenues will soar higher as crypto connect launches and expands, along with the existing partnerships and new launches."

(Post 3 of 3) 
* Revenues soar, analysts initiate coverage with bullish price targets that need to be raised every quarter on bullish guidance from management. The stock gains momentum and becomes a Wall Street/Crypto-adjacent favorite... a premium valuation is assigned to the triple-digit growth that Bakkt will deliver. The stock has the potential to become a 10X trade in the next 12 months. 
 
* We all have seen this scenario play out for much lesser companies than Bakkt in the past. It will not be a surprise as Bakkt follows the pattern in this template that is very common for strong emerging growth companies. 
 
I am long shares of BKKT."

If you believe Biden, then yes, it may be a good time to let the bulls out of their cages.

If you think Biden might be lying in the same way Trump&#39;s Fed pick (J. Powell) has been for years, then you might want to hold them back a little longer. I&#39;m talking about Powell saying inflation was transitory and the repo market activity in Sept 2019 was &quot;not QE.&quot; BS. We all knew it was. 

Also... 

We still haven&#39;t seen capitulation.

We still haven&#39;t see massive failures. 

We still haven&#39;t seen panic (in the US).

It&#39;s been almost a decade AND a half since markets have truly gone into panic mode, unless you count 2020 but the Fed blasted so much cash into the system it lasted less than a month.

&quot;BTC and ETH are different.  BTC is perceived value, so that can stay up as long as people want to buy it. It seems like it has a future as it is already part of our collective consciousness. ETH on the other hand is supposed to have utility, and it has none. I expect that price to go right back to $200,&quot; he said.

Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research says the idea of decentralization, where power is shifted from the hands of centralized entities is the ‚Äústupidest thing ever‚Äù and pointed out that the only utility Bitcoin has is that it is a collective consciousness of people, with people buying because others are.

2022-07-15T19:29:23Z,JackD1875,4614675,NIL,$BTC.X I&#39;ve seen a lot of comparing the current crypto crash to the dot com bubble of 2000 because they both had total market caps of 3 trillion dollars and there are similarly too many projects being released at once many of which are useless and won&#39;t make it into the crypto world of the future but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere close to a crypto bubble. Microsoft began publicly trading on the stock exchange around 1985 and I think there are similarities to the creation of $ETH.X Ethereum and $QNT.X Quant around 2015. It took 15 years from the start of the computer and the internet to become a bubble in early 2000 that subsequently collapsed and I think we&#39;ll be in a Crypto bubble between 2030-2032 when the total crypto market cap reaches the area of 30 trillion dollars before collapsing. There will probably be a lull in early to mid 2030&#39;s before the market ramps back up again in late 2030&#39;s. I think we will hit a total crypto market cap of 300 trillion at some point in early 2050&#39;s.

It is healthy for the excessive speculation to be washed out of the crypto industry during this current phase of emerging growth for this technology. Losing technology speculation is now failing, while winning technology is being adopted globally. The global adoption of the crypto economy continues unabated. The technology is disruptive, and the use cases are strong. 
 
The crypto genie won&#39;t be put back into the bottle. Crypto became a global fixture some years ago. Now the race is for American companies to prosper and grow so that our nation leads in this vital technology. 
 
Bakkt is one of those emerging growth companies with an opportunity to leverage off of the dozen global clearing houses already established by its parent company, ICE. We are ready to launch partnerships and see Bakkt&#39;s stock run back up the chart to the $20 range in the near term."

That&#39;s what actual investors look at to determine positions.  Just buying and hoping is not an investment strategy.  Can it turn bullish? Absolutely. I believe it will and make a new ATH.

Two separate events occurred in the crypto space today that suggest a market bottom may already have been achieved for crypto: 
1) Celsius filed for bankruptcy today, yet Bitcoin and the altcoins traded higher. Veteran traders understand that when markets trade higher on bearish news, the bottom may already be in for that market. The shakeout in crypto firms failing from excessive speculation in the space is running its course. Not only did the Celsius negative news have no bearish impact on the crypto market, Bitcoin is actually up by nearly 5% today. Ether is up over 10%. Higher beta altcoins are up by more with a gain of 21% for MATIC in today&#39;s single trading session. 
When markets trade higher on bearish news... it is a bullish indicator that a bottom may already have been achieved."
2022-07-14T21:41:44Z,BullnBearTrading,1578839,Bullish,"$BTC.X $ETH.X  
(Post 2 of 3) 
2) M&amp;A activity is a strong indication that industry insiders sense prices are cheap, and that making purchases at these levels is buying the bottom. FTX&#39;s recent, high profile M&amp;A activity has been covered in the media. FTX&#39;s M&amp;A moves have been clear signs that industry leaders believe crypto asset prices are cheap. Here is another very minor indication that industry insiders are seeing, &quot;Unprecedented opportunities,&quot; for asset purchases in crypto. Cleanspark (CLSK) has scooped up over 1,000 mining rigs at, &quot;an exceptionally discounted price.&quot;

(Post 3 of 3) While FTX&#39;s M&amp;A activity is taking place on a much larger level by purchasing equity in crypto companies, Cleanspark is providing evidence that prices may have bottomed on smaller asset purchases also. In this case, by purchasing at total of 2,861 mining rigs at very steep discounts.  
 
The market is telling us that from top to bottom, asset prices are on sale, and this consolidation phase is running its course. Historically, this type of due diligence by traders who are finding discounted asset prices has resulted in a favorable entry point for a long trade, that may result in significant profits in the future. 
 
Veteran traders will harken back to the shakeout of the PC revolution, the Biotech revolution, the Internet revolution, and see that the current opportunities in the digital asset revolution are wealth-building trades. Traders do not build wealth buying the tops of markets. Wealth is built buying the bottoms of markets. That time may be now."

Although the best investors and #traders understand the importance of patience, it is one of the most difficult skills to learn as an investor and trader. 
 
Patient investing is similar to fishing. There are many fish in the sea and it isn&#39;t necessary to catch every fish that swims by in order to be successful. In fact, it&#39;s only necessary to catch those few that bite and fill up your net (or that meet your trading criteria). 
 
It is important to remember that there are always many trading opportunities in the market, even in a tough market, so the difficulty is not so much in finding trading opportunities, but making sure the opportunities fit your trading rules. It is vital that you concern yourself with getting good entry points and making sure you have defined exit points along with exit strategies without having to get in on every trade.

Hopefully everybody is aware of the upside and downside risks of leverage trading. Hopefully people actually do actual research now before investing. 

Being arrogant about spending money you spend, thinking you may not need it tomorrow, without considering other variables like the cost effects on consumer products due to inflation and interest rate hikes, may come and haunt you later.

This is the greatest and fastest economic recovery of all time and it is the direct result of  Biden working tirelessly to stop Putin&#39;s price hikes and inflation and racism and transphobia too.  Unlike that idiot Trump who golfed all day, Biden is working around the clock to lead this great country to better days. Just imagine how bad things would be with that orange racist bigot still in office. The NASDAQ would be down over 90% and we would all be speaking Chinese or Russian. The recession is fake news. The reality is that 17 of 17 nobel prize winning economist agree that Biden&#39;s 3.5 trillion dollar American rescue plan prevented a recession. Did I mention that the Biden administration has created more jobs than any administration before them in just their first year? The Biden Boom is here and the economy is stronger and more diverse than ever before."

Furthermore, the different types of uncertainty reinforce each other. Political polarisation, which tends to make economic policy erratic, is fuelled by high inflation. All this means the economy is harder to forecast, making life harder for central banks, in turn spooking investors. The fragmentation of global trade doesn‚Äôt help. The unwinding of supply chains encourages stockpiling during booms and fire-sales during busts, amplifying economic swings. 
 
Persistent uncertainty means a higher cost of capital and less affordable insurance against shocks. All of which tends to dampen business investment, weighing on gdp growth and equity returns. There have been many dark days for the nasdaq in 2022: the index has already recorded 32 daily falls of more than 2% since January. This time their entry on the calendar of doom looks deserved."

Retail got spooked out on the 40k ride down. Big boys are positioning themselves as best as they can to minimize big(er?) losses. That can appear to be &quot;propping&quot; up a price so they can skim off any upward enthusiasm.  
  
It has been known for a long time that bitcoin itself (not blockchain tech!) is not built for commerce. The &quot;store of value&quot; thesis is being tested this year and appears to be losing in 10k increments.  The &quot;inflation hedge&quot; thesis is being mocked.

The big surprise, though, was a decision to suspend share repurchases. Together, the news signals that the bank is preparing for a weakening economy.  
 
That isn‚Äôt the only problem that looks to be sending the S&amp;P 500 is set to see its fifth straight day of losses. Inflation continues to soar and the Federal Reserve is now likely to act even more aggressively in lifting interest rates to combat higher prices. A full percentage-point rate increase is on the table, instead of the three-quarter point increase the market had been expecting. ‚ÄúThe Fed may indeed hike 100 basis points at the July meeting,‚Äù wrote Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research."

During the first Cold War, the Soviet Union and other Marxist-communist regimes experienced an ongoing emigration of the wealthy and the educated who sought to flee the oppression and failing economies of Marxist nations.  
 
This became known as the ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù where talent and wealth would leave Marxist nations to flee to the capitalist democracies of the western world. The brain drain became such a severe problem for Marxist nations, that the Soviet Union literally locked their people inside of the USSR behind the ‚ÄúIron Curtain.‚Äù  
 
Today, this Iron Curtain is beginning to re-emerge as western sanctions, Russia‚Äôs authoritarian oppression, and the immorality of Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine are driving the wealthy and educated into a mass exodus out of Putin‚Äôs tyrannical Russia. America would be wise to attract some of these educated and wealthy business owners from Russia:

(Post 1 of 2) Good morning to the pre-market of Thursday 7/14/22 with major stock indexes in the red, and Bitcoin in the green as the leading crypto attempts to regain the $20K level. Following yesterday&#39;s red hot 9.1% CPI data point, later this morning the market awaits the June Producer Price Index, or PPI number.  
 
Also to be released is the weekly jobless claims. Both reports will give the market more data on the condition of the economy. Much of the market now believes that the Federal Reserve Bank is poised for as much as a 100 basis point increase in interest rates during the July meeting of the FOMC in two weeks."

(Post 2 of 2) If there is any positive news in the current hot inflation data, it is that forward-looking data points suggest a cooling economy as commodity prices have decreased, and indicators like auto loan repos have exploded higher.  
 
The market is expecting inflation data to be softer in July forward. Softer inflation data may begin to give the fed some room to ease the aggressive actions it is taking to slow the economy. Most are expecting a recession in the coming quarters, if we are not already in one now.

I didn&#39;t check any platforms to see if indeed the bearish pattern did form, but that&#39;s how saw this setup &gt;&gt; 

When was the last bearish reversal pattern for $BTC.X and what was that pattern?

BEARISH HARAMI CROSS

This is a major bearish reversal pattern, which is even more significant than a regular Bearish Harami. 

Recognition Criteria

1. The market is characterized by a prevailing uptrend.
2. A white body is observed on the first day.
3. The Doji that is formed on the second day is completely engulfed by the body of the first day.

Pattern Requirements and Flexibility

The Bearish Harami Cross consists of two candlesticks, in which the body of the first white candlestick engulfs the body of the following Doji. The body of the first candlestick may be short.

Definition

This pattern is characterized by a large white body engulfing a preceding smaller black body, which appears during a downtrend. The white body does not necessarily engulf the shadows of the black body but totally engulfs the body itself. This is an important bottom reversal signal.

1. The market is characterized by a prevailing downtrend.
2. A black body is observed on the first day.
3. The white body that is formed on the second day completely engulfs the black body of the preceding day.

Embattled crypto lender Celsius files for bankruptcy protection

PUBLISHED WED, JUL 13 20227:03 PM EDTUPDATED AN HOUR AGO

Crypto company Celsius has started the process of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Earlier, CNBC reported the company‚Äôs lawyers were notifying individual U.S. state regulators of those plans, according to a source, who asked not to be named because the proceedings were private.

Celsius made headlines a month ago after freezing customer accounts, blaming ‚Äúextreme market conditions‚Äù and joins a list of other high-profile crypto bankruptcies.

Embattled crypto lender Celsius informs state regulators that it‚Äôs filing for bankruptcy &#39;imminently,&#39; source says

Prince&#39;s comments come as the crypto market has crashed in 2022. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) currently sits just above $19K after having traded just under $69K late last year. Ethereum (ETH-USD) hovers above $1K after topping $4.8K last year. 
 
Meanwhile, popular names like Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD) and Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) have all fallen at least 60% so far in 2022. However, looking at these declines, Prince still sees long-term value. 
 
&quot;We&#39;re going to look back years down the road from now at prices that were observed over the next few weeks and months and say, &#39;that was a phenomenal time to build a position,&#39;&quot; he said.

Early this month, embattled BlockFi entered into a deal with FTX to receive a $400M revolving credit facility. The agreement also includes an option for FTX to potentially purchase BlockFi. 
 
Asked if BlockFi was on the verge of bankruptcy when the deal was struck, Prince avoided the question but noted &quot;we had a lot of options.&quot; 
 
Looking at the overall crypto market, Prince predicted that the industry would survive &quot;whatever this is going to be&quot; because of the long-term value of individual projects. Specifically, he pointed to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) emerging as a potential store of value and the continued development of blockchain technology. 
 
&quot;This is a market that&#39;s going to be in a long-term growth trend. There&#39;s a lot of very valuable things happening in this sector,&quot; he said.

However, speaking to CNBC, the head of the cryptocurrency exchange pushed back on the idea that the firm was close to becoming another high-profile casualty of the current market downturn, saying its situation was not comparable to those of flameouts like Celsius and Luna. 
 
Drawing parallels to 2008, when a bankruptcy at Lehman Brothers sparked the beginning of the financial crisis, Prince said, &quot;It&#39;s night and day. You can&#39;t compare Goldman to Lehman Brothers in terms of how they&#39;ve continued to operate.&quot; 
 
He added: &quot;With the passing of time, folks will realize how different platforms like BlockFi are from some of those [others].&quot;

It was quickly bought up and then we had a nice rally. Many facts in the charts themselves indicate we may have perhaps already bottomed. Lots of people ready to buy the dip. Good sign.Other macro economic factors make it seem as if more downside is to come. Hard to know. I can see we had a 3 Black Crow pattern in the charts. This is usually followed by a relief rally then a bigger drop. We are now getting that relief rally looks like.  I am cautiously still watching. I have a nice starter position in btc and eth. If we drop more, I will add more. Once I know for sure we are at bottom, will go in heavier. Remember this, if everyone is expecting 10k, it will not happen and you will keep waiting and miss the bottom. Market always does opposite of the masses. We MAY be at bottom now. But don&#39;t listen to me. This is just my 2 cents. DYOD."

(Post 1 of 2) Today&#39;s CPI number was expected to be hot, but it actually surprised by coming in even hotter than expected. A &quot;9 handle&quot; on the 9.1% YoY inflation increase was worse than the market expected. However, the initial selloff in the market was cushioned by a bounce that followed.  
 
All 3 major indexes closed off of their lows for the session, albeit they were all still in the red. Bitcoin has traded into the green for most of today. The question we want to consider is, &quot;Why did markets bounce today when the inflation data was so bearish?&quot;  
 
High inflation is bearish for stocks, so why didn&#39;t the market sell off sharply, and then stay down? Why did traders step in to buy the dip today? The answer may be that traders believe there is a good chance that we are moving past peak inflation, and that future numbers are likely to be less bearish."

(Post 2 of 2) Please note that I carefully chose to say that upcoming data in the future may be less negative than today&#39;s redhot print of 9.1%. I was careful not to say that the near term data will be bullish. At this point in the market&#39;s bear cycle, we are glad to receive data that is simply less inflationary.  
 
We are a long way from the Fed&#39;s target of 3% inflation, so we likely will remain in this current environment of a hawkish fed aggressively conducting rate hikes and QT simultaneously. Short term traders in this market are likely to step in for a short term trading rally off of the current levels, I believe.  
 
In fact, it is possible that the market may have quietly put in a bottom on June 16th as commodities were falling sharply. Now we are seeing broader signs of an economic slowdown, and this could be enough for the market to finally end its long selloff.:"

Why did stocks bounce today and why was I a buyer off the open? Simple. Too many people got bearish into the CPI print.

Why did I decide to sell into the rally? As I told members, Jim Cramer, Jeremy Seigel and the rest of the mkt bulls made my decision easier. EVERYONE claimed peak inflation. EVERYONE  was saying it&#39;s time to buy stocks. And thats just not how the mkt works. It will contunue to trap. It will continue to frustrate. Sure, we could be at peak inflation, but that doesn&#39;t mean stocks have bottomed. The contrarian trade continues to work and has worked all year. Buy the panic. Sell the exuberance.

Ask your broker and he will explain it to you if you want to short Canadian real estate in the summer of 2022 when the bank of canada has raised interest rates 250% in 18 months with house prices for private and commercial real estate still raising with speculators. Many young Canadians are now underwater on their investment real estate. 2022 has been the worst year for the stock market since 1970 and the worst year for the bond market since 1788.

Market pricing in an 82% chance of a 100bps hike this month likely followed by another 75bps hike the month after.
Starting to see cuts in Q1 2023.

Inflation is expected to come down. Bond markets are screaming of a recession.

Logically speaking, risk-reward is much better from a bullish stand point in prep for the FED to pause and risk to rally.

Some mining outfits are even shutting off rigs, because they can&#39;t profit, at this level. That is an inherently self tightening development, which is a reasonable hypothetical price support floor. Only time will tell, but I think it is a smart time to buy into BTC. Especially in light of all the USD inflation. Whatever monetary policy they adopt for USD, real rates will STILL be negative.

So, here‚Äôs where I say it again- todays news?  Already priced in.  It always is. It is exactly why the White House leaked what they did yesterday (hence the drop yesterday).  Rate hikes?  Priced in.  99% of the macro news?  Priced in. The only things that aren‚Äôt, are black swan events (Covid, a nuke, etc).  

Markets are forward thinking. They are ALWAYS several steps ahead of what is really happening.  The economy does NOT have to recover before the markets do. Look back in hx- they always recover well before a war ends or the economy actually rebounds. By the time you hear any news of recovery, you have missed the boat. 

That being said, I still think we will go lower (based on Elliotts) - although nowhere near as low as many say (my PT was the 78.6 fib @ 16.9). I also think we have peaked &amp; that #‚Äôs will look much better next month. We already know prices have come down on fuel etc. 

I am looking for a rebound in Sept &amp; a few good mos followed by a disastrous 2023. Jmo."

Apparently, in the eyes of politicians, the average Joe / Jane six pack want 2 changes: lower gas prices and lower price on said metaphorical six pack. First objective achieved faster than expected, now to bring down price of said six pack. Paradoxically, if you believe inflation is top of mind for average voter then to make said voter happy, perceived purchasing power must be reduced, and threat of unemployment must increase.

(Post 1 of 2) Good morning on this Wednesday 7/13/22 with the pre-market showing all 3 indexes basically flat. Bitcoin is up 200 points, although trading below the $20K level again. The markets are awaiting the important Consumer Price Index (CPI) this morning at 8:30 am, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) scheduled for tomorrow 7/14/22, and a key retail report on Friday 7/15/22.  
 
It is widely expected that the June CPI will come in hotter than May, but that will be headline number. Reading below the headline, the market is looking for what might be the 3rd consecutive monthly slowdown for inflation. Food and energy continue to be the drivers of the inflationary headline number for June."

(Post 2 of 2) Markets are taking some solace in the fact that energy has declined sharply thus far in July, leading some to speculate that inflation may have peaked for the near term. Some market watchers would like to believe that inflation is now peaking, but not so fast. We still must contend with the global dynamics of an energy market that could rapidly accelerate to higher prices. For this reason, markets are unlikely to become sanguine about a several month trend of declining core inflation numbers that seems to be emerging:

34 coins

You decide to sell half your position at 60k last November because you know it‚Äôs close to top? No of course not you just do that because you like to play it safe

Now you own 17 coins and have your one million in cash back 

You decide to reinvest that million between 15K to 18K before the next cycle 

Why? Because it‚Äôs bottom ? No you have no way to know that but you like this price point 

Now you buy another 60 BTC plus do not forget you already have 17 coins so you have a total of 

77 BTC at a cost of your original one million 
Average is 13K per coin

So in 2025 you decide to sell at 113K per BTC for 8.7 million in 4 years or a profit of 7.7 million

Don‚Äôt worry about tops or bottoms just execute your strategy and stick to it

Best wishes to all"

80 percent down at 13 700 per btc perhaps

Both Grayscale, the manager of GBTC, and BlockFi have been exposed to bankrupt Three Arrows. BlockFi has already incurred $80M in losses from 3AC&#39;s bad debt, Bloomberg noted, adding that 3AC held 5% of GBTC at one point. 
 
#BlockFi CEO Zac Prince wrote in a Twitter post Monday that his company &quot;directly holds zero GBTC,&quot; and &quot;we have small loans (like $10M) w/ GBTC as collateral that are in the process of winding down.&quot;
